This is a project I set up to deal extensively with frontend input of user data, upload and doownload of files, pagination and hostinf databse on Postgress (On my pc). The lessons I learnt through it all atr hilighted below


------------Lessons----------
1. You may not use schema for Form data - it is that flexible
2. The names on the html (frontend) and the endpoints (backend) must be the same, same as the name of the endpoints themselves
